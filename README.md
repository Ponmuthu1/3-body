# Three-Body Simulation

This project simulates the gravitational interactions between two suns and a planet using GlowScript.

## Features

- Simulates the movement of celestial bodies based on gravitational forces.
- Visualizes the orbits and positions of the bodies.
- Allows switching the camera focus between different objects (planet, sun1, sun2) by pressing 'f'.

## How to Run

You can view the simulation online at: [Three-Body Simulation](https://chess-ai.me/3-body/)

## Controls

- **Switch Follow Target:** Press 'f' to cycle through objects.

## Deployment

This project is deployed using GitHub Pages. You can visit the live site [here](https://chess-ai.me/3-body/).
